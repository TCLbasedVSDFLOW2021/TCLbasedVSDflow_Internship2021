# TCLbasedVSDflow_Internship2021
The internship to develop IP/VLSI system design flow at $0 cost using opensource EDA tools are being organized by https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/ip/ . This is very good opportunity to develop skillset by doing projects on your own and implement ideas. The project topic is "TCL based 'vsdflow' for OpenLANE/Sky130" wherein VLSI system design flow (RTL to GDSII) needs to be developed using TCL scripting on OpenLANE platform using Google's free process design kit (PDK) sky130A.

# About the Project
- VSDFLOW is an automated framework of RTL to GDSII flow built completely using open source EDA tools and PDKs with it’s final hardware presenting performance–area metrics of the design. Different open-source tools are used at each stage of the physical design flow. OpenLANE is accelerating through the industry that provides various opensource EDA tools at one place wherein the complete VSDFLOW (RTL to GDSII) can be performed. Hence, by using the TCL (Tool Command Language) scripting the VSDFLOW can be automated. In this project, OpenLANE will be used for performing the VSDFLOW through TCL scripting and Google's Skywater 130nm PDK will be used for the CMOS circuit named SPI Slave design.
